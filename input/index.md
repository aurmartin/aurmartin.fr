## About Me

I have experience designing and implementing scalable web applications using a range of technologies and frameworks, including Elixir, React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. My expertise in both front-end and back-end development allows me to tackle complex projects and deliver high-quality solutions.

Whether working independently or as part of a team, I am committed to delivering maintainable, well-documented code that adheres to best practices and industry standards.

## My Projects

I have worked on a variety of hobbyist projects. You can find some of them on my [GitHub](https://github.com/aurmartin) profile.

The most notable projects I have worked on are:
- [ExTick](https://github.com/aurmartin/extick): a project management application I'm building to learn more about Phoenix LiveView. You can find the live version of the app [here](https://extick.aurmartin.fr/).
- [Alien](https://github.com/aurmartin/Alien): a hobbyist operating system written in C and assembly. With this project I learned a lot about low-level programming, memory management, file systems, drivers, etc.
- [BetterVelovMap](https://github.com/aurmartin/bettervelov): a web application to visualize the availability of bikes and parking spots in the city of Lyon. You can find the live version of the app [here](https://velov.aurmartin.fr/).
- [tcp-over-udp](https://github.com/aurmartin/tcp-over-udp): a really simple implementation of the TCP protocol over UDP in C.

## About This Site

This site is inspired by [gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/) awesome website! I wanted to have a simple and clean website to showcase my projects and blog posts. I also wanted to have a website that I could easily update and maintain. I decided to build it using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator, and host it on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The design of this site is made to be clean and minimal to focus on its content. I also wanted to avoid using too much CSS and JavaScript to keep the site as lightweight and accessible as possible.

For the moment there is not much content on this site. I only wrote a couple of blog posts and added some projects. I will try to build the habit of writing to improve my style and push me to do some research on topics that interest me.
