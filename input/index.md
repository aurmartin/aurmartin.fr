## About Me

I have experience designing and implementing scalable web applications using a range of technologies and frameworks. My expertise in both front-end and back-end development allows me to tackle complex projects and deliver high-quality solutions.

Whether working independently or as part of a team, I am committed to delivering maintainable, well-documented code that adheres to best practices and industry standards.

## My Projects

I have worked on a variety of hobbyist projects. You can find some of them on my [GitHub](https://github.com/aurmartin) profile.

The most notable projects I have worked on are:
- [ExTick](https://github.com/aurmartin/extick): a project management application I'm building to learn more about Phoenix LiveView. You can find the live version of the app [here](https://extick.aurmartin.fr/).
- [BetterVelovMap](https://github.com/aurmartin/bettervelov): a web application to visualize the availability of bikes and parking spots in the city of Lyon. You can find the live version of the app [here](https://velov.aurmartin.fr/).
- [Alien](https://github.com/aurmartin/Alien): a hobbyist operating system written in C and assembly.
